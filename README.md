# SAVING STRATEGY



PObjective
An application that helps calculate and manage savings over a specified period based on customizable saving strategies. The app allows users to select a frequency (daily, weekly, or monthly), an amount to save, and a savings goal or end date. The app calculates and displays the cumulative savings over time

    Features

        1. Savings Frequency

            Users can choose the frequency of saving:
              (i)      Daily
              (i)      Weekly
              (iii)    Monthly

        2. Customizable Savings Amount

            Users can set the amount to save each day, week, or month, or follow a progressive pattern where the amount increases with each interval:
              (i)      Fixed amount: Save the same amount in each interval.
              (ii)     Incremental amount: Increase the saving amount by a fixed increment in each interval (e.g., save $1 on Day 1, $2 on Day 2, etc.).
            
        3. Savings Goal or End Date

            Users can specify:
              (i)      A total savings goal (e.g., save $100).
              (ii)     A time-based end point (e.g., save for 30 days).

        4. Cumulative Savings Calculation

            The app calculates and displays:
              (i)      The savings for each interval.
              (ii)     The cumulative total saved so far.

        5. Output and Visualization

            Users can view:
              (i)      A detailed list of savings per interval.
              (ii)     A summary of the total amount saved.
              (iii)    Optional: A visual representation (e.g., a progress bar or chart).

    Example:

        User sets the frequency to "Daily," the amount to increment by $1, and a duration of 5 days.

          Savings Breakdown:
            Day 1: Save $1 (Total = $1).
            Day 2: Save $2 (Total = $3).
            Day 3: Save $3 (Total = $6).
            Day 4: Save $4 (Total = $10).
            Day 5: Save $5 (Total = $15).
